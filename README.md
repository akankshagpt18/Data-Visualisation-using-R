Emoji Twitter data Visualization using R for breeds of dogs
As a dog lover, I wanted to do visualization of the tweets on all the post for the different breeds of dogs. I have extracted data from Twitter for different types of breeds of dogs. These types are as follows:
1)Golden retriever 2)Labrador Retriever 3)Husky 4)Beagle 5)Corgi
I am trying to visualize that which type of emojis ate being used for them and also comparing them to analyze which of the breeds are most famous on social media. Turns out most famous breed is Golden Retriever and it has the highest number of pictures posted on twitter.
