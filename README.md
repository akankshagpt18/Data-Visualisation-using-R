Emoji Twitter data Visualization using R for breeds of dogs: 
As a dog lover, I wanted to do a visualization of the tweets for the different breed of dogs. I have extracted data from Twitter for different types of breeds of dogs. These types are as follows:
1)Golden retriever 2)Labrador Retriever 3)Husky 4)Beagle 5)Corgi
I am trying to visualize the type of emojis used for them and also comparing them to analyze which of the breed is more popular on social media. Turns out most famous breed is Golden Retriever( I have two Golden retriever so I was not surprised.. ;)) and it has the highest number of pictures posted on twitter.
